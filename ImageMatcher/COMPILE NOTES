WORKING in 10.6 and 10.5

Dl and compile libjasper, libjpg,libtiff and libzlib using ./configure CXXFLAGS="-Os -arch i686" --target=i686-apple-darwin10
One of these didn't use the configure, make setup but instead used ccmake. In that case I set the arch to i686 and min version to 10.4
[make -ja, make install]

In opencv 2.3 ccmake, set arch to i686, no shared, min target of 10.4, no cuda, no tiff
[make -j8, sudo make install]

Open CV will also compile liblibjasper.a     liblibjpeg.a     liblibpng.a     liblibtiff.a     libzlib.a if compile 3rd pary is turned on in cmake,
this may mean you can skip all the libraries compiled above

They are named liblib____ so they will need to be copied so they are found by the compiler for ImageMatcher


ImageMatcher : GenerateDescriptors.cpp MatchParam.h
        g++ -o ImageMatcher GenerateDescriptors.cpp -fno-stack-protector -mmacosx-version-min=10.4 -no_compact_linkedit -L/usr/local/share/opencv/3rdparty/lib/ -arch i686 -m32 -lz -ljasper -lpng -ljpeg -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_ml -lopencv_video -lopencv_features2d -lopencv_calib3d -lopencv_objdetect -lopencv_contrib -lopencv_legacy -lopencv_flann


Notice the addition of 
-L/usr/local/share/opencv/3rdparty/lib/ to use the 3rd Party compiled Libs
